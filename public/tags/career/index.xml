      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am leaving NOVI. Yes, I know, it is sad news. For almost 6 years I have been building and maintaining an organisation that provides the best cybersecurity and software development (Bachelor) education in The Netherlands. In that time I have done amazing things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Created a short course format for people that want to switch careers. With some back of the napkin calculations I have seen over 2500 students pass through one of the programs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I lead a team of quality assurance, educational development, EduTech developers and teachers to build an awesome EduTech tool and provide top-notch education.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Started and hosted the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:35817/posts/resigning-as-htb-ambassador/&#34; class=&#34;backlink&#34;&gt;Hack The Box NL meetups&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; for 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I became part of the management team and helped the organisation through an M&amp;amp;A proces&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a wild ride, but like all things that begin, it must end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/2eWAMw6JENTsbKRwodQv1c?si=936fd9ebd14f4d02&#34;&gt;Application Security podcast with Jim Routh&lt;/a&gt; in which he talks about the 15 year cycle of his career. At first I thought that it did not make much sense, but after a while of reflecting on that statement I found that I myself have a 10 year cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my career there have been blocks of 10 years in which my interest and career change and re-align.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first cycle was Software Development. I started as a software engineer (programming professionally) in 1996, working in the Dutch industry and then at Personify in San Francisco. When I moved back to The Netherlands I worked at Tiscali where I transitioned from software development into architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cycle two was all about architecture. From Tiscali I moved on to eBuddy in 2006 as the lead architect for our chatplatform. It was a beautiful combination of coding and designing and I look back at it with great love. From the insane time at an internet startup I moved into an architecture role at Infomedics. I combined my coding and architecture skills to build out an amazing platform that serves millions of people on a daily basis. During my time at Infomedics I achived a Bachelor Degree in ICT and I started making Cyber Security a more present part of my career, from obtaining certifications such as CEH and OSCP to managing ISO 27001 and ISAE 3402 certifications for our tech teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third cycle is education. From 2016 onward I have worked in education. First I did it as a hobby project, next to my work hours I would give classes at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam in Infrastructure Security, Forensics, Software Security and guided students in their projects and final exams. I even created a completely new Associate Degree in Cybersecurity. In 2019 I made a full switch to education by joining NOVI. During my time at NOVI I attained my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:35817/posts/master-of-science/&#34; class=&#34;backlink&#34;&gt;Master&amp;#39;s Degree&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and transitioned into a more strategic role where I managed a large part of the organisation next to giving classes and building curricula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now my fourth cycle has appeared. Each cycle up to now has brought me amazing challenges, wonderful people and a lot of knowledge. So it is an exciting time to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
