      <title>Choose your tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on 2024-09-30 (Monday).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ to build software. I sadly do not have a lot of time next to my daily work to spend on my side projects, so I have to be disciplined in where I invest time. I wish I could spend endless amounts of time on exploring new technologies, but sadly I simply do not have that time. In writing this is sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;to kill your darlings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Traefik</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://traefik.io/traefik/&#34;&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt;. It is a reverse proxy built specifically for services in the cloud. I was searching for a convenient (up-to-date) way to expose my project using a reverse proxy within &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;. I used to use &lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; for this, but it then requires a generator and an lets encrypt listener (so 3 containers). Traefik only requires a single container and allows you to label your docker containers to apply rules to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhance testability with selmer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first article in a series called &lt;strong&gt;Rock Solid Software&lt;/strong&gt;. In it I explore different dimensions of software that does not simply break. You can write good software in any programming language, although some are more suited to a disciplined practice then others, Clojure is definitely in the &lt;em&gt;relaxed&lt;/em&gt; space of discipline here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I am exploring the use of Selmer templates in Clojure. If you have explored &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biffweb.com&#34;&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt; at all you will know that all the UI logic works by sending &lt;code&gt;Hiccup&lt;/code&gt; through a handler, which will turn into HTML through &lt;code&gt;rum&lt;/code&gt; (specifically the &lt;code&gt;wrap-render-rum&lt;/code&gt; middleware). If you provide a vector as a result for an endpoint, it will be converted to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a longer form article. I is relevant as of &lt;strong&gt;February 18th 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. If the circumstances of my environment changes I will try to update this article to reflect the situation. You can find the full source code of my dotfiles on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/credmp/nixos-dotfiles/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like consistency and simplicity. I do not like to use many different tools to do different things, I rather spend my time learning to use a few tools very well then to follow the hype on the latest trend of tools for something we have been doing forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how it was to ship a product out to half a million people back in 1999. But before I do that, let me tell you why. Today I talked to one of my students and he mentioned that he was very nervous about a change he was making. He was afraid it would break things and that he would spend the afternoon working through his CI/CD pipeline to resolve issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
