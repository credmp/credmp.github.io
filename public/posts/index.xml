      <description>A little later then usuals. Yesterday I was at the Dutch ComicCon, and I forgot to post. Here is my reading of last week.&#xA;The Real Impact of AI I think we’re all wondering about the deeper effects of weaving AI into our daily lives. This week, I found a few articles that really made me stop and think. The first was a standout study from MIT that suggests using tools like ChatGPT for writing could lead to a kind of &amp;ldquo;cognitive debt.</description>

      <description>Software Engineering In my feed the opening talk by DHH at Rails World 2024 popped up, most notably due his stance on the reduction of complexity in running an online business. He promotes running your own (virtual) hardware, reducing build pipelines and not using Platform as a Service providers (#nopaas). Watch it below.&#xA;It really interested me, for my hobby projects I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time and I would like the experience to be as smooth as butter.</description>

      <description>Tech in general I learned that most of the layoffs in the US are not so much about AI taking jobs. Sure, there are bound to be a bunch of people that are no longer employed because their jobs was easily replaced by a system, but there is more then meets the eye. In &amp;ldquo;The hidden time bomb in the tax code that&amp;rsquo;s fueling mass tech layoffs&amp;rdquo; explores the tax rule that was changed under Trump-I, section 174, which basically no longer allows companies to write-off R&amp;amp;D effort in the current fiscal year.</description>

      <description>How Vibe Coding Fails Up to now The video I am commenting on below is part of a series called Vibe-coding in het onderwijs. So far, the series has been excellent! It shows teachers how they can create small tools for their class using AI such as ChatGPT and bolt.new. The projects featured had very little actual logic or complexity, and the use of AI was spot-on! Now, take a look at the following video.</description>

      <description>Will software development change? Yes, of course. Will we stop making software? No, we&amp;rsquo;ll still be creating software, just not in the same way as before.&#xA;For the last few months, a lingering question in our industry has been: is there still room for developers in this AI-driven world? My answer is yes, but we won&amp;rsquo;t be developing in the same way we have for the past 30 years.&#xA;My career dates back to my first professional coding job in 1996.</description>

      <description>I am leaving NOVI. Yes, I know, it is sad news. For almost 6 years I have been building and maintaining an organisation that provides the best cybersecurity and software development (Bachelor) education in The Netherlands. In that time I have done amazing things:&#xA;Created a short course format for people that want to switch careers. With some back of the napkin calculations I have seen over 2500 students pass through one of the programs.</description>

      <description>When I tell people that I like to code in Clojure the common response is &amp;ldquo;wut?&amp;rdquo;. Clojure is not known as a programming language in which you create big systems. As all Clojure people know, this is not true. There are many systems written in Clojure. Let me show you some that are very actively maintained.&#xA;First there is Lipas, a Finnish platform that shows you information about sports clubs. The structure and techniques used in this code base I use as a reference implementation for my own ClojureScript + Clojure systems.</description>

      <title>Observability in Clojure</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/20250201-observability-in-clojure/</link>

      <description>Observability in cloud-native applications is crucial for managing complex systems and ensuring reliability (Chakraborty &amp;amp; Kundan, 2021; Kosińska et al., 2023). It enables continuous generation of actionable insights based on system signals, helping teams deliver excellent customer experiences despite underlying complexities (Hausenblas, 2023; Chakraborty &amp;amp; Kundan, 2021). In essence, adding proper observability to your system allows you to find and diagnose issues without having to dig through tons of unstructured log files.</description>

      <title>Digital Ocean, its support and development database</title>

      <description>Tip Currently, only use Postgres 14 on the Digital Ocean application platform for development databases. While following the book Zero2Prod you will learn how to deploy a Rust application to digital ocean through a Continuous Deployment pipeline. This is hardly anything new for me, I even teach a course in DevOps, but to not stray from the path of the book I followed its instructions.&#xA;The spec for digital ocean looks like this (this is abbreviated for your reading pleasure):</description>

      <title>The joy of NixOS</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/20250111-happy-with-nixos/</guid>
      <description>In July 2023, I installed NixOS as my daily operating system. NixOS is a Linux distribution that emphasizes a declarative approach to system management. This means you define your desired operating system configuration in a file (e.g., KDE with Emacs 30 and Firefox), and the Nix package manager uses that file to create your OS. Every change generates a new version, allowing you to revert to a previous version if anything goes wrong.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I highlighted that I set myself the goal of creating a self hosted comic book collection tool. Before that, in a post about tooling , I reiterated my ❤️ for Clojure as a language. So, this is the start of a series of articles detailing how the development is going, and also as an introduction to the various parts of the tech stack.&#xA;Clojure is special to me in that there are hardly any big frameworks in the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>So, a new year, a new theme! I switched my blog to use the Today I Learned Theme. This theme has a great feature where it also maintains a collection of notes and shows a graph with related notes. This is very similar to how I use org-roam.&#xA;I will not be transferring all my notes over, but I thought it would be a very nice feature to share some of my notes with you.</description>

      <description>Note Originally posted on 2024-09-30 (Monday). It was updated in January of 2025. I ❤️ to build software. I sadly do not have a lot of time next to my daily work to spend on my side projects, so I have to be disciplined in where I invest time. I wish I could spend endless amounts of time on exploring new technologies, but sadly I simply do not have that time.</description>

      <description>It is December again and that means it is time for the Advent of Code. Due to my workload and family obligations I will probably not be able to get very far this year, but still I wanted to write a post about it.&#xA;This year I am using Java, together with my students. My goal is to write as modern as possible Java, which means using streams and new language constructs where possible.</description>

      <description>My old laptop, now almost 6 years old, has seen it all. From conferences, to lectures, traveling to distant places and to the library. I did a lot of work on it during the writing of my thesis, and it is a victim to countless hours of compiler time.&#xA;Sadly the battery started to die. It got to the point that you can only use it shortly for heavier loads. Luckily, unlike certain hardware (looking at you Apple), it is easy to fix.</description>

      <description>Today the academic world is remembering Bastiaan Heeren, who passed away last week.&#xA;I spent the better time of a year working on my thesis, and before that I enjoyed lectures given by Bastiaan. He was a person with a great love for teaching, especially when you can get into the nitty gritty details of software quality and the benefits of functional programming.&#xA;I look back fondly on my time with Bastiaan.</description>

      <description>I recently came across Traefik. It is a reverse proxy built specifically for services in the cloud. I was searching for a convenient (up-to-date) way to expose my project using a reverse proxy within docker-compose. I used to use nginx for this, but it then requires a generator and an lets encrypt listener (so 3 containers). Traefik only requires a single container and allows you to label your docker containers to apply rules to them.</description>

      <description>This is my first article in a series called Rock Solid Software. In it I explore different dimensions of software that does not simply break. You can write good software in any programming language, although some are more suited to a disciplined practice then others, Clojure is definitely in the relaxed space of discipline here.&#xA;Today I am exploring the use of Selmer templates in Clojure. If you have explored Biff at all you will know that all the UI logic works by sending Hiccup through a handler, which will turn into HTML through rum (specifically the wrap-render-rum middleware).</description>

      <description>Je hebt tijd gereserveerd om te gaan studeren en je volgt een ritueel om goed in jouw &amp;ldquo;Deep Work&amp;rdquo; modus te komen, dat studeren gaat echt goed lukken! Tijdens de colleges en in de lesmaterialen vind je allerlei links naar papers, websites, YouTube videos en haal je veel informatie uit boeken. Al deze bronnen zijn zeer waardevol en bij de eindopdracht zul je veel van deze bronnen weer moeten gebruiken om argumenten te onderbouwen of juist iets te ontkrachten.</description>

      <description>In mijn vorige artikel heb ik uitgelegd hoe je tijd kunt vinden om te studeren, de vraag is echter, is alle tijd hetzelfde? Het simpele antwoord is &amp;ldquo;nee&amp;rdquo;. Maar waarom niet, zul je vragen, en daarmee komen we op het onderwerp van dit artikel.&#xA;Cal Newport heeft een fantastisch boek geschreven, &amp;ldquo;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&amp;rdquo;. In dit boek onderzoekt hij hoe je gefocust werkt en wat er voor nodig is om gefocust te blijven [1].</description>

      <description>This is an English article, there is also a Dutch version.&#xA;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start studying? Maybe you want to earn your Bachelor or Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for that highly technical certificate. It&amp;rsquo;s great that you&amp;rsquo;re taking this step, but once you begin, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly need to answer the question of where you&amp;rsquo;ll find the time.&#xA;Time is our most valuable, non-renewable resource. Studying requires time – and not just a little – so you naturally want to use it well.</description>

      <description>This is a Dutch artcile, there is also an English version.&#xA;Dus, jij hebt besloten om te gaan studeren? Misschien wil je jouw HBO- of Masterdiploma halen, of juist dat ene supertechnische certificaat bemachtigen. Het is geweldig dat je deze stap gaat zetten, maar zodra je begint, zul je vrij snel de vraag moeten beantwoorden waar je de tijd vandaan haalt.&#xA;Tijd is onze meest waardevolle, niet-hernieuwbare bron. Studeren vergt tijd – en niet zo&amp;rsquo;n klein beetje ook – dus wil je het natuurlijk goed doen.</description>

      <description>So, today I have some news. I will be resigning as Ambassador for Hack The Box after our in-person meetup in June (2024). This means that I will be stepping down from organizing the monthly virtual and quarterly in-person Hack The Box meetups. Let me explain how I got to this decision.&#xA;The beginning So, in 2019, I started out building a cyber security curriculum for NOVI Hogeschool. I had the ability to greenfield the courses and create something that is of value to students.</description>

      <description>This post is just a small note for those of you who also run Microsoft Teams on Linux through their browser and now receive a note &amp;ldquo;your browser does not meet the requirements for the new Teams&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that the client is looking at the user-agent string to determine which browsers it accepts, and which not.&#xA;So, if you have the message, install an user-agent switcher and select a common browser on a common OS (from the MS perspective) and you will suddenly meet the requirements.</description>

You can find the full source code of my dotfiles on Github.&#xA;I like consistency and simplicity. I do not like to use many different tools to do different things, I rather spend my time learning to use a few tools very well then to follow the hype on the latest trend of tools for something we have been doing forever.</description>

      <description>It has been a little while. I have been swamped with work and the work on my thesis, leaving no room to finish the Advent of Code or much of anything else.&#xA;Yesterday I gave my practice presentation for my thesis. This means I am one more step closer to the finish line. During the day there were many interactions with fellow students. One of the topics has been the templates to use at Open Universiteit.</description>

A simple quest to find the next number in a sequence with a fully written out algorithm to follow. They key here is to use recursion.&#xA;go go code snippet start&#xA;package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; &amp;#34;arjenwiersma.nl/aoc/internal/aoc&amp;#34; ) func NextStep(in []int) int { allZero := true for _, v := range in { if v !</description>

      <description>Somewhat suspicious of 2 easy days we end up at Day 8. A simple map to follow again, from one key follow the instructions until we hit ZZZ. Part 2 had us do it for several keys at once, with the goal to find the spot where they all converge. This can take forever, erhm, a long time.&#xA;So there has to be a math type solution to this problem. It turns out to be a Least Common Multiple problem.</description>

      <description>Today we learned about CamelCards, a game of poker meant to play on the back of a camel. The most interesting part here was the parsing of the cards and figuring out how to properly rank them. Part 2 turned out to be as easy as tracking Jokers.&#xA;go go code snippet start&#xA;package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sort&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strconv&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; &amp;#34;arjenwiersma.nl/aoc/internal/aoc&amp;#34; ) type Card struct { bid int hand []int jokers int } func (c *Card) strongerThen(o *Card) bool { for i, v := range c.</description>

      <description>Day 6 turned out to be the easiest day in the range so far. A simple implementation of the algorithm was more than sufficient.&#xA;I later learned that it was a quadratic function. On the subreddit Deatranger999 said:&#xA;If you hold down the button for x seconds, then you will beat the distance if the quadratic x^2 - t x + d is at most 0, where t is the total time of the race and d is the distance you&amp;rsquo;d like to beat.</description>

      <description>Today was an interesting problem. We are basically given a map to follow based on a number, possibly transforming the number at each step. With a single number this is quite simple, just apply the rules and step through each set of transformations. The problem becomes tricky when it turns out we have to deal with enormous ranges of numbers. On the subreddit some people reported their implementation to take hours and use 20GB of memory.</description>

      <description>The difficulty is going up and down. This day was quite easy in comparison to yesterday. Today it was about parsing some numbers and finding a set of winning numbers.&#xA;As I am doing these puzzles in Go I found out that there is no default set type. There is an implementation by HashiCorp named go-set that fills this void. I did not use an external package (I try to avoid them while doing AoC), but I am very tempted to pull that package in.</description>

      <description>Day 3 was quite something. I think that in an attempt to make it harder for AI to solve the puzzles the creators also increased the difficulty level of the base puzzles a little too much. The test was not very clear as to what should happen with negative numbers and it might trip people up. The puzzle itself is a great to exercise grid knowledge as you have to work with neighbors and you have to extend the numbers when you find them.</description>

      <description>Day 2 was another fun challenge. Lots of splitting of strings. I wonder if there is a better way to filter out the min and max value from the separate grabs.&#xA;I am sure I will not be able to complete all challenges this year, but so far so good.&#xA;go go code snippet start&#xA;package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strconv&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; ) type Grab struct { red, green, blue int } type Game struct { id int grabs []Grab } func main() { content, _ := os.</description>

      <description>The Advent of Code has started again. At NOVI we participate with a group of our students. We use the AoC throughout the entire curriculum as practice exercises to learn new programming languages or the application of data-structures and algorithms.&#xA;Day 1 was a tricky start for most people. Part 1 was not too bad, but part 2 tripped most people up. I guess the idea was that you would have to solve the challenge with an array iteration, but most students tripped up.</description>

      <description>As the warm haze of summer gives way to the crisp air of autumn, the season marks a pivotal moment in my academic journey: the commencement of my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis project. Having successfully had my research proposal accepted earlier this year, I now face the last leg of this marathon—bringing my theoretical framework to life.&#xA;The Powerhouse Partnership: Open Universiteit and CWI While undertaking a Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis is a significant endeavor on its own, I always have to make it more complex.</description>

      <description>Working on my thesis research proposal has been quite the journey, and not always in the direction I would have chosen. A personal revelation that struck me during the process is the tight and rather vexing relationship between perfectionism, procrastination, and paralysis.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s often said that the perfect is the enemy of the good. In my quest for the &amp;lsquo;just right&amp;rsquo; words to articulate my thoughts, I found this saying to be glaringly accurate.</description>

      <description>Using AI, in particular generative models such as GPT, are in contention within academics. The purity of academics resides in students writing on their research and having their work peer-reviewed. But how can you now be sure that the student wrote the paper and how can you trust its content? Many universities, including the OU have written about it. The OU published an article in Modulair about it. Generally, the consensus seems to be that it is ok to use AI as an assistant, but you must write your texts.</description>

      <description>Today, I took the first step towards starting my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. I have decided to document my journey and experiences on my blog. Given that the thesis will play a pivotal role in my life for the next nine months, I expect it to be a thrilling journey.&#xA;Finding a topic As a student at Open Universiteit in The Netherlands, I had the opportunity to work with the Rascal programming language during the Software Quality Management course.</description>

      <description>Background I have been working on getting my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Software Engineering. To do this I have started following courses at the Dutch Open Universiteit. They have a Master&amp;rsquo;s program that takes 2 years and you are able to follow it from home.&#xA;As this is my first post on the courses, I will give some background. As a teacher it is recommended to have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree. As I had a whole lot of work experience my teaching activities were not a problem, but from an overall point of view I was advised to pursue an Master degree.</description>

      <description>Let me tell you how it was to ship a product out to half a million people back in 1999. But before I do that, let me tell you why. Today I talked to one of my students and he mentioned that he was very nervous about a change he was making. He was afraid it would break things and that he would spend the afternoon working through his CI/CD pipeline to resolve issues.</description>

      <description>I use lsp-mode quite extensively. I switched from eglot when I started using LSP more. The beautify of lsp-mode is that it will automatically install language servers as you need them. It also integrates excellently with dap-mode to enable debugging sessions. So, I switched to it, turned off all the information overload and I am quite happy.&#xA;One thing I do extensively is that I use LaTeX to make my slides for college class slides and class assignments.</description>

      <description>As the world is processing the Twitter deal the open source project Mastodon is gaining a lot of traction. The instance that I am on, fosstodon, is run by a small team and is fully funded by donations.&#xA;Now this may sound somewhat strange; as the twitterverse is blowing up about $8/month for a blue checkmark I would argue that the $8 is better spent supporting open source projects. As developers, security people, and users we rely on a lot of free time and effort from open source contributors.</description>

      <description>Where to begin&amp;hellip; I just watched David Wilson&amp;rsquo;s talk called M-x forever - why Emacs will outlast text editor trends. He gave this talk at EmacsConf 2021 which is a conference dedicated to Emacs. The talk made me reflect on my use of Emacs over the last years and then I realized that this year will mark 22 years that Emacs and I have been together. This (probably too long) article reflects on those years and dives into my use of Emacs.</description>

Due to COVID-19 they have all been as a digital meetup, but not less entertaining though.&#xA;During my time organizing the meetups the Hack The Box organization supports me in various ways; they give me stuff to hand out such as swag or VIP memberships, they help organize speakers for events when we don&amp;rsquo;t have one ourselves and they provide me with Hack The Box goodies every once in a while.</description>
