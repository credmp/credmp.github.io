    <p>Using AI, in particular generative models such as GPT, are in contention within academics. The purity of academics resides in students writing on their research and having their work peer-reviewed. But how can you now be sure that the student wrote the paper and how can you trust its content? Many universities, including the OU have written about it. The OU published an article in <a href="https://modulair.ou.nl/modulair-2023-april/chatgpt-in-het-onderwijs">Modulair about it</a>. Generally, the consensus seems to be that it is ok to use AI as an assistant, but you must write your texts.</p>
<p>For me AI has proven to be a valuable assistant. Here are some ways in which I found AI to be extremely useful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blank page syndrome&rdquo; refers to the common experience of feeling stuck and overwhelmed when faced with a blank document. It can hinder productivity and creativity in academic writing. Thankfully, AI-powered tools have been developed to combat this syndrome. Utilizing natural language processing algorithms, these tools can generate ideas, provide content suggestions, and even create outlines to jumpstart the writing process. Examples of such tools include <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/">LLaMA</a>, which have proven to be invaluable resources for overcoming this challenge.</p>
<p>Take the following, <a href="https://medium.com/@ryan.craven.qa/mastering-ai-prompts-comprehensive-guide-for-better-output-68aa2d104f21">simplified</a>, prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing a blog post on using AI to write academic papers. I want to cover &ldquo;blank page syndrome&rdquo;, &ldquo;finding related works&rdquo; and &ldquo;spelling and grammar correction&rdquo;. Your task is to work as my writing assistant. Write an outline for this article.</p></blockquote>
<p>Results in the following outline:</p>
