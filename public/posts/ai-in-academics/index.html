    <p>Using AI, in particular generative models such as GPT, are in contention within academics. The purity of academics resides in students writing on their research and having their work peer-reviewed. But how can you now be sure that the student wrote the paper and how can you trust its content? Many universities, including the OU have written about it. The OU published an article in <a href="https://modulair.ou.nl/modulair-2023-april/chatgpt-in-het-onderwijs">Modulair about it</a>. Generally, the consensus seems to be that it is ok to use AI as an assistant, but you must write your texts.</p>
<p>For me AI has proven to be a valuable assistant. Here are some ways in which I found AI to be extremely useful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blank page syndrome&rdquo; refers to the common experience of feeling stuck and overwhelmed when faced with a blank document. It can hinder productivity and creativity in academic writing. Thankfully, AI-powered tools have been developed to combat this syndrome. Utilizing natural language processing algorithms, these tools can generate ideas, provide content suggestions, and even create outlines to jumpstart the writing process. Examples of such tools include <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/">LLaMA</a>, which have proven to be invaluable resources for overcoming this challenge.</p>
<p>Take the following, <a href="https://medium.com/@ryan.craven.qa/mastering-ai-prompts-comprehensive-guide-for-better-output-68aa2d104f21">simplified</a>, prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing a blog post on using AI to write academic papers. I want to cover &ldquo;blank page syndrome&rdquo;, &ldquo;finding related works&rdquo; and &ldquo;spelling and grammar correction&rdquo;. Your task is to work as my writing assistant. Write an outline for this article.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the utilization of AI tools in academic writing can have a transformative impact on researchers. By leveraging AI-powered text generation and proofreading capabilities, academics can experience a multitude of benefits. Firstly, AI tooling allows for increased writing velocity, enabling researchers to produce content more efficiently. With AI&rsquo;s assistance, the time-consuming process of meticulously correcting spelling and grammar errors is significantly reduced, freeing up valuable time for researchers to focus on the critical thinking process. As a result, the overall quality of written work can be elevated, ensuring that ideas are effectively conveyed and scholarly contributions are of the highest standard. By embracing AI tooling, academics can embrace a more streamlined and effective approach to writing, empowering them to make significant strides in their research endeavors.</p>
