    Advent of Code 2025 Day 4 | Arjen Wiersma
</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Day 4 of solving The Advent of Code in Clojure .
The first grid problem of the season! The first part was really suspiciously easy, read in the grid, find all the rolls and look at its 8 neighbors, eliminating it if there are less than 4. The 2nd part was a nice progression on this.
Instead of just saying how many should be eliminated, we do it until there are no eliminations possible. This is highly reminiscent of a Conway Game of Life puzzle. In Clojure this is quite nicely done by reading the grid as a vector, and then ranging over all the coordinates. On each coordinate just take a look at the neighbors and apply the logic. Its pure nature means that the functions are already working in the right way to do this repeatedly." />
