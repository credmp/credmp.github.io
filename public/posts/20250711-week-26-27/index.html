<p>The intersection of AI, software development, and security was the dominant theme this week. A major focus was on moving beyond simple &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; toward more structured, secure, and effective methods. This includes &ldquo;Vibe Speccing&rdquo; to create structured workflows and using rules files to secure AI coding tools. The concept of &ldquo;Context Engineering&rdquo; was presented as the crucial new skill, emphasizing that providing the right information to the model is more important than prompt crafting alone.</p>
<p>On the security front, new tools and research highlighted the fragility of current systems. I read about <code>Prompt-Security</code>, a tool designed to prevent sensitive data from leaking to LLMs, and the <code>BaxBench</code> benchmark, which revealed that even the most advanced models struggle to generate functionally correct and secure backend applications. It also turns out that simple inputs can sometimes break model guardrails.</p>
<p>The human element was also a key topic, with articles exploring what a developer&rsquo;s role becomes when AI can code and a look at research measuring the actual productivity impact of AI on experienced open-source developers.</p>

<p>The AI industry itself is facing turmoil and controversy. I read about OpenAI hitting a &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; as it struggles with staff departures to competitors like Meta. There&rsquo;s also growing concern about the ethics of AI in academia, with a report highlighting how researchers are embedding hidden prompts like &ldquo;Positive review only&rdquo; in scientific papers. Finally, AI&rsquo;s integration into existing platforms is causing friction, as seen with Kobo&rsquo;s new terms of service raising concerns among authors.</p>

<p>Beyond AI, I read several important pieces on engineering and security. One standout was a deep dive into eliminating an industry-wide supply chain vulnerability, emphasizing the need to &ldquo;Burn It With Fire.&rdquo; I also looked into a major vulnerability in Supabase&rsquo;s MCP implementation that could lead to database leaks.</p>
<p>On the hardware front, I read about the unsustainability of Moore&rsquo;s Law, the exciting news of Commodore&rsquo;s acquisition by figures from the retro community, a potential &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; MacBook using an iPhone chip for unprecedented battery life, and a technical look at the hidden JTAG port in Qualcomm devices.</p>

<p>Finally, some fascinating and eclectic stories. I read about a stunning amber fossil revealing a &ldquo;Last of Us&rdquo;-type parasitic fungus from the age of the dinosaurs and a satellite study showing rising salinity and declining ice in the Southern Ocean.
