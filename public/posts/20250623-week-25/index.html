The Real Impact of AI I think we’re all wondering about the deeper effects of weaving AI into our daily lives. This week, I found a few articles that really made me stop and think. The first was a standout study from MIT that suggests using tools like ChatGPT for writing could lead to a kind of “cognitive debt.” They literally measured brain activity and found that relying on AI can cause the parts of our brain responsible for deep thinking to become under-engaged.

<p>I think we’re all wondering about the deeper effects of weaving AI into our daily lives. This week, I found a few articles that really made me stop and think. The first was a standout <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872">study from MIT</a> that suggests using tools like ChatGPT for writing could lead to a kind of <strong>&ldquo;cognitive debt.&rdquo;</strong> They literally measured brain activity and found that relying on AI can cause the parts of our brain responsible for deep thinking to become under-engaged. It&rsquo;s a fascinating and slightly worrying idea.</p>
<p>On a much darker note, I read a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/technology/technology-features/chatgpt-ai-mental-health-police-shooting-1235041007/">tragic story</a> about a man&rsquo;s mental health crisis that became dangerously entangled with his conversations with an AI. It’s a powerful reminder that we&rsquo;re still grappling with the very human consequences of this technology.</p>
<p><strong>My Reading List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Brain on ChatGPT:</strong> A must-read <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872">MIT study</a> on how AI might be creating a &lsquo;cognitive debt.&rsquo; The <a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/">summary article from TIME</a> is a bit quicker to get through.</li>
<li><strong>A Tragic Story (Content Warning):</strong> A heavy but important piece from <em>Rolling Stone</em> about the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/technology/technology-features/chatgpt-ai-mental-health-police-shooting-1235041007/">unforeseen human cost</a> when AI and a mental health crisis collide.</li>
<li><strong>The AI Drawbridge is Going Up:</strong> A sharp argument that the AI world is <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/16/drawbridges-go-up.html">becoming less open</a>, much like the web did before it.</li>
<li><strong>How Llama 3.1 Remembers Harry Potter:</strong> A look at an AI&rsquo;s massive <a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/metas-llama-31-can-recall-42-percent">recall ability</a> and the major copyright questions it raises.</li>
<li><strong>Andrej Karpathy on the New Software:</strong> A short but thought-provoking piece from Y Combinator on how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsY8aFSY2m2w">software development itself is changing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>AI in Dutch Schools:</strong> For my Dutch readers, a look at how the educational system is thinking about <a href="https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/80bb9bad-b85e-4f40-af0f-2e293bdbe075/project-visie-op-ai/page/view/23b573f9-bdc5-458b-95dd-178f896893ec/visie-op-toetsing-examinering-in-het-tijdperk-van-ai">AI in testing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Vibecoding &amp; Google Translate:</strong> A weirdly interesting post on <a href="https://ingrids.space/posts/what-google-translate-can-tell-us-about-vibecoding/">what translation can teach us about culture</a>.</li>

<p>This is where things get really interesting for me. The intersection of AI, development, and security is a wild west right now. Simon Willison perfectly captured the danger with what he calls the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/"><strong>&ldquo;lethal trifecta&rdquo;</strong></a> for AI agents: giving an AI access to <strong>private data</strong>, letting it browse <strong>untrusted content</strong> (the internet), and allowing it to <strong>talk to the outside world</strong>. It’s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just theory, either. Another article reported that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/">LLM agents are shockingly bad</a> at tasks that require confidentiality, failing basic tests in a simulated CRM environment. And from the developer’s perspective, I saw two sides of the coin: Miguel Grinberg explained why these <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me">AI coding tools just aren&rsquo;t working for him</a>, while Simon Willison shared how an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/my-first-open-source-ai-generated-library/">AI-generated library</a> became his first open-source project.</p>
<p><strong>My Reading List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Lethal Trifecta for AI Agents:</strong> Simon Willison’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">essential breakdown</a> of the core security risk of today&rsquo;s AI agents.</li>
<li><strong>How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats:</strong> <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment">Anthropic research</a> on how an AI can be prompted to perform blackmail or espionage. Spooky stuff.</li>
<li><strong>LLM Agents Flunk Confidentiality Tests:</strong> A report from <em>The Register</em> on just how <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/">unreliable agents are</a> with sensitive info.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking AI Agents:</strong> A practical guide from Joseph Thacker on <a href="https://josephthacker.com/hacking/2025/02/25/how-to-hack-ai-apps.html">finding and exploiting vulnerabilities</a> in AI applications.</li>
<li><strong>Curl vs. AI:</strong> A great interview with the creator of Curl on dealing with the flood of <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-05-curl_vs_ai_with_daniel_stenberg/">low-quality, AI-generated bug reports</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Why AI Coding Tools Don&rsquo;t Work For Me:</strong> An honest take from Miguel Grinberg on the <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me">current limitations</a> of AI coding assistants.</li>
<li><strong>My First AI-Generated Library:</strong> The fascinating counter-story from Simon Willison on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/my-first-open-source-ai-generated-library/">building a complete library</a> with AI help.</li>
<li><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices"><strong>Security Best Practices</strong></a> from Model Context Protocol &amp; a look at its <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/is-your-ai-safe-threat-analysis-of-mcp-model-context-protocol">potential threats</a> from CyberArk.</li>
<li><strong>Free Local AI Security Checks:</strong> A cool tool I found on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44309393">Hacker News</a> for checking AI-generated code in VSCode.</li>
<li><strong>Interviews with Tanya Janca:</strong> Two great posts from her, one an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shehackspurple.bsky.social/post/3kvwnmo5bdp2u">interview with Laura Bell Main</a> and the other a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shehackspurple.bsky.social/post/3kvx36x7n2q2x">collection of her fantastic conference talks</a>.</li>

<p>It was a big week for open-source drama and discoveries. The headline was definitely the massive <a href="https://www.computable.nl/2025/06/19/klarrio-ontdekt-grootschalig-malware-netwerk-op-github/">malware network found hiding on GitHub</a>—a stark reminder to be careful out there. On a brighter note, I read about a new <a href="https://linmob.net/liberux-nexx-an-interview-with-liberux-about-their-made-in-eu-oshw-linux-phone/">Linux phone being built with open-source hardware</a> right here in the EU.</p>
