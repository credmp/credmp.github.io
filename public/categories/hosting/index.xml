      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online services seem to take more and more money to use, they are also getting new features such as AI which might not be entirely what you want. I certainly do not want some random AI system training on my personal data. So I decided to start self-hosting the services that I use. I have been working on internalizing services for almost a year now, and I figured it is time to write some things down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
