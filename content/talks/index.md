AI is revolutionizing software development, promising unprecedented speed. But blindly accepting AI-generated code – a practice coined "vibe coding" – can swiftly lead to security nightmares, as illustrated by real-world examples of exposed keys, bypassed payments, and chaotic architectures. This talk dissects the inherent risks when developers, especially those new to coding, leverage AI without oversight. I contrast risky "AI-driven" development with secure "AI-enhanced" development practiced by experienced engineers. Drawing on over 30 years in software and cybersecurity, I present seven essential rules for building secure applications in the age of AI. Learn how to evaluate generated code, apply established standards, perform effective testing, manage complexity, ensure documentation, and stay ahead of emerging AI security threats like prompt injection. Equip yourself to harness AI's power safely and build robust systems, avoiding the pitfalls of the security nightmare.

The video is a rehearsal recording for the [Almere Tech](https://www.meetup.com/almere-tech/) meetup. The talk was great fun in a real setting as there is audience interaction and lots of fun to be had, but the rehearsal shows the structure and the topics covered.

# Places where I presented this talk 
- [Almere Tech #27](https://www.meetup.com/almere-tech/events/305045942/): a great local meetup here in Almere where I did my first run of this talk
- Scyon HQ: nothing is scarier than presenting in front of your colleagues, but on an AI themed day I did just that.
- [DevPulse #3](https://zwinc.nl/events/devpulse-3): I was a guest at DevPulse #3 in Zwolle. Presenting for the tech community in the north of The Netherlands. Great venue, cool people.

# Future Places
- [TechSummit Amsterdam 2025](https://techsummit.io): on September 16th I will be presenting at TechSummit.
- [Devoxx Belgium](https://devoxx.be/app/talk/3252/vibecoding-your-way-into-a-security-nightmare): my first international speaking gig!
