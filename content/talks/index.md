# Talks

I occasionally speak at conferences and meetups. Below are some of my active talks that I am presenting. If you would like me to present at your conference or meetup, feel free to contact me.

## Offensive AI

At [J-Fall 2025](https://www.jfall.nl) I gave a workshop on how to break AI systems. We explored the challenges you face when trying tp integrate AI into your own systems and the sharp edges of implementations.

There is no recording of this workshop, but I have a (stripped) version of [my slide deck available](Offensive-AI-public.pdf). 

## Vibe-coding your way into a security nightmare

AI is revolutionizing software development, promising unprecedented speed. But blindly accepting AI-generated code – a practice coined "vibe coding" – can swiftly lead to security nightmares, as illustrated by real-world examples of exposed keys, bypassed payments, and chaotic architectures. This talk dissects the inherent risks when developers, especially those new to coding, leverage AI without oversight. I contrast risky "AI-driven" development with secure "AI-enhanced" development practiced by experienced engineers. Drawing on over 30 years in software and cybersecurity, I present seven essential rules for building secure applications in the age of AI. Learn how to evaluate generated code, apply established standards, perform effective testing, manage complexity, ensure documentation, and stay ahead of emerging AI security threats like prompt injection. Equip yourself to harness AI's power safely and build robust systems, avoiding the pitfalls of the security nightmare.

Below is the recordings from Devoxx Belgium 2025.

A shorter version of the talk was given at TechSummit 2025.
