These are some of my project that I have worked on that have become more then just a thing for myself.

# Personal Open Source

2. [HED](https://github.com/credmp/hed): a hostfile editor for use on Hack The Box
3. [Pandoc HBO](https://github.com/credmp/pandoc-hbo): a docker container to wrap TeXLive for students
