When I tell people that I like to code in {{< backlink "clojure" "Clojure">}} the common response is "*wut?*". Clojure is not known as a programming language in which you create big systems. As all Clojure people know, this is not true. There are many systems written in Clojure. Let me show you some that are very actively maintained.

First there is [Lipas](https://www.lipas.fi/liikuntapaikat), a Finnish platform that shows you information about sports clubs. The structure and techniques used [in this code base](https://github.com/lipas-liikuntapaikat/lipas/) I use as a reference implementation for my own ClojureScript + Clojure systems. A screenshot of the application is shown here:

Next, there is [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), a business intelligence platform. The below gif shows you some of the features it has.

There is a great talk at Conj 2024 about supporting 50000 users on Metabase. You can watch it over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUe3slLHk20&list=PLZdCLR02grLr4TWUP6qeLxIn4OJLNwKNZ&index=6).

Finally, also found on the Conj 2024 streams, there is Cisco Threat Intelligence API. This a full threat intelligence service and data model that is built using Clojure. Link to the [repository](https://github.com/threatgrid/ctia). The talk about the project can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIzIR-cHty4&list=PLZdCLR02grLr4TWUP6qeLxIn4OJLNwKNZ&index=5).

There are plenty of other projects using Clojure, if you know of more that I should add to my list, do let me know!
