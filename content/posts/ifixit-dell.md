My old laptop, now almost 6 years old, has seen it all. From conferences, to lectures, traveling to distant places and to the library. I did a lot of work on it during the writing of my thesis, and it is a victim to countless hours of compiler time.

Sadly the battery started to die. It got to the point that you can only use it shortly for heavier loads. Luckily, unlike certain hardware (looking at you Apple), it is easy to fix. All it needs is a new battery. So I found that [ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide) had the right parts and a **very** useful kit with all the right tools to do the job.

It only took 10 minutes to do, and now my trusty old laptop is able to last 7 to 8 hours again! Gotta love the ability to repair things. I hope it lasts another 5 to 6 years!
