A little later then usuals. Yesterday I was at the Dutch ComicCon, and I forgot to post. Here is my reading of last week.

## The Real Impact of AI

I think we’re all wondering about the deeper effects of weaving AI into our daily lives. This week, I found a few articles that really made me stop and think. The first was a standout [study from MIT](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872) that suggests using tools like ChatGPT for writing could lead to a kind of **"cognitive debt."** They literally measured brain activity and found that relying on AI can cause the parts of our brain responsible for deep thinking to become under-engaged. It's a fascinating and slightly worrying idea.

On a much darker note, I read a [tragic story](https://www.rollingstone.com/technology/technology-features/chatgpt-ai-mental-health-police-shooting-1235041007/) about a man's mental health crisis that became dangerously entangled with his conversations with an AI. It’s a powerful reminder that we're still grappling with the very human consequences of this technology.

**My Reading List:**

  * **Your Brain on ChatGPT:** A must-read [MIT study](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872) on how AI might be creating a 'cognitive debt.' The [summary article from TIME](https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/) is a bit quicker to get through.
  * **A Tragic Story (Content Warning):** A heavy but important piece from *Rolling Stone* about the [unforeseen human cost](https://www.rollingstone.com/technology/technology-features/chatgpt-ai-mental-health-police-shooting-1235041007/) when AI and a mental health crisis collide.
  * **The AI Drawbridge is Going Up:** A sharp argument that the AI world is [becoming less open](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/16/drawbridges-go-up.html), much like the web did before it.
  * **How Llama 3.1 Remembers Harry Potter:** A look at an AI's massive [recall ability](https://www.understandingai.org/p/metas-llama-31-can-recall-42-percent) and the major copyright questions it raises.
  * **Andrej Karpathy on the New Software:** A short but thought-provoking piece from Y Combinator on how [software development itself is changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsY8aFSY2m2w).
  * **AI in Dutch Schools:** For my Dutch readers, a look at how the educational system is thinking about [AI in testing](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/80bb9bad-b85e-4f40-af0f-2e293bdbe075/project-visie-op-ai/page/view/23b573f9-bdc5-458b-95dd-178f896893ec/visie-op-toetsing-examinering-in-het-tijdperk-van-ai).
  * **Vibecoding & Google Translate:** A weirdly interesting post on [what translation can teach us about culture](https://ingrids.space/posts/what-google-translate-can-tell-us-about-vibecoding/).

### AI Security & Development: A Messy Frontier

This is where things get really interesting for me. The intersection of AI, development, and security is a wild west right now. Simon Willison perfectly captured the danger with what he calls the [**"lethal trifecta"**](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) for AI agents: giving an AI access to **private data**, letting it browse **untrusted content** (the internet), and allowing it to **talk to the outside world**. It’s a recipe for disaster.

This isn't just theory, either. Another article reported that [LLM agents are shockingly bad](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/) at tasks that require confidentiality, failing basic tests in a simulated CRM environment. And from the developer’s perspective, I saw two sides of the coin: Miguel Grinberg explained why these [AI coding tools just aren't working for him](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me), while Simon Willison shared how an [AI-generated library](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/my-first-open-source-ai-generated-library/) became his first open-source project.

**My Reading List:**

  * **The Lethal Trifecta for AI Agents:** Simon Willison’s [essential breakdown](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) of the core security risk of today's AI agents.
  * **How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats:** [Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment) on how an AI can be prompted to perform blackmail or espionage. Spooky stuff.
  * **LLM Agents Flunk Confidentiality Tests:** A report from *The Register* on just how [unreliable agents are](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/) with sensitive info.
  * **Hacking AI Agents:** A practical guide from Joseph Thacker on [finding and exploiting vulnerabilities](https://josephthacker.com/hacking/2025/02/25/how-to-hack-ai-apps.html) in AI applications.
  * **Curl vs. AI:** A great interview with the creator of Curl on dealing with the flood of [low-quality, AI-generated bug reports](https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-05-curl_vs_ai_with_daniel_stenberg/).
  * **Why AI Coding Tools Don't Work For Me:** An honest take from Miguel Grinberg on the [current limitations](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me) of AI coding assistants.
  * **My First AI-Generated Library:** The fascinating counter-story from Simon Willison on [building a complete library](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/my-first-open-source-ai-generated-library/) with AI help.
  * [**Security Best Practices**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices) from Model Context Protocol & a look at its [potential threats](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/is-your-ai-safe-threat-analysis-of-mcp-model-context-protocol) from CyberArk.
  * **Free Local AI Security Checks:** A cool tool I found on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44309393) for checking AI-generated code in VSCode.
  * **Interviews with Tanya Janca:** Two great posts from her, one an [interview with Laura Bell Main](https://bsky.app/profile/shehackspurple.bsky.social/post/3kvwnmo5bdp2u) and the other a [collection of her fantastic conference talks](https://bsky.app/profile/shehackspurple.bsky.social/post/3kvx36x7n2q2x).

### Open Source News

It was a big week for open-source drama and discoveries. The headline was definitely the massive [malware network found hiding on GitHub](https://www.computable.nl/2025/06/19/klarrio-ontdekt-grootschalig-malware-netwerk-op-github/)—a stark reminder to be careful out there. On a brighter note, I read about a new [Linux phone being built with open-source hardware](https://linmob.net/liberux-nexx-an-interview-with-liberux-about-their-made-in-eu-oshw-linux-phone/) right here in the EU.

  * **Massive Malware Network on GitHub:** The story of how Klarrio [uncovered a huge, malicious network](https://www.computable.nl/2025/06/19/klarrio-ontdekt-grootschalig-malware-netwerk-op-github/) on the world's biggest code platform.
  * **A New EU-Made Linux Phone:** An [interview with the folks at Liberux](https://linmob.net/liberux-nexx-an-interview-with-liberux-about-their-made-in-eu-oshw-linux-phone/) about their open-source hardware phone.
  * **Open Source Can't Coordinate:** A short but insightful post on the [challenges of getting things done](https://matklad.github.io/2025/05/20/open-source-cant-coordinate.html) in open-source projects.

### Dev Tools I'm Eyeing

I'm always on the lookout for tools that can make my workflow a little better. This week, a keyboard-centric [setup for VSCode + Neovim](https://medium.com/%40nickmaslov/vscode-neovim-setup-keyboard-centric-powerful-reliable-clean-and-aesthetic-development-b4f04c641f9) caught my eye, along with a tool for smarter [`git squash`](%5Bhttps://github.com/edverma/git-smart-squash%5D\(https://github.com/edverma/git-smart-squash\)) commands.

  * **VSCode + Neovim Setup:** A guide for anyone who wants a [powerful, keyboard-first](https://medium.com/%40nickmaslov/vscode-neovim-setup-keyboard-centric-powerful-reliable-clean-and-aesthetic-development-b4f04c641f9) development environment.
  * **Git-Smart-Squash:** A tool that looks like it could really [clean up my git workflow](https://github.com/edverma/git-smart-squash).
  * **Harper Grammar Checker:** A [free, open-source, and privacy-focused](https://writewithharper.com) alternative to other grammar tools.
  * **On Software Complexity:** A meta-analysis of three different ways to think about [what makes software "complex."](https://typesanitizer.com/blog/complexity-definitions.html)
  * Also, I've just been keeping up with [**David Heinemeier Hansson's blog**](https://world.hey.com/dhh). Always a good read.

### And Finally, Something Completely Different...

To cleanse the palate after all that heavy reading on AI risk and malware, here’s a fantastic video on how to make [Gözleme](https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dytrw31lmH-A), the amazing Turkish flatbread snack. Enjoy\!
