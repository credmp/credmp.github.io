So, a new year, a new theme! I switched my blog to use the [Today I Learned Theme](https://github.com/michenriksen/hugo-theme-til). This theme has a great feature where it also maintains a collection of notes and shows a graph with related notes. This is very similar to how I use org-roam.

I will not be transferring all my notes over, but I thought it would be a very nice feature to share some of my notes with you. This year I am focussing on {{< backlink "choose-your-tools" "Clojure">}} and {{< backlink "rust" "Rust">}}, and as a result I will be posting my notes on the new things I learn.

I set myself a goal of creating a "self hosted comic book collection tool". It should be very nice to create this using the insights from {{< backlink "zero2prod" "Zero 2 Production">}}. My blog will be a sort of development log along the way.
