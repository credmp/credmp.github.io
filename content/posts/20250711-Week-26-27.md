This week's reading was a deep dive into the world of AI-assisted development, its security implications, and the evolving role of the human developer. I also explored significant topics in hardware, software supply chain security, and some fascinating findings from the world of science.

# AI in the Trenches: Development and Security

The intersection of AI, software development, and security was the dominant theme this week. A major focus was on moving beyond simple "vibe coding" toward more structured, secure, and effective methods. This includes "Vibe Speccing" to create structured workflows and using rules files to secure AI coding tools. The concept of "Context Engineering" was presented as the crucial new skill, emphasizing that providing the right information to the model is more important than prompt crafting alone.

On the security front, new tools and research highlighted the fragility of current systems. I read about `Prompt-Security`, a tool designed to prevent sensitive data from leaking to LLMs, and the `BaxBench` benchmark, which revealed that even the most advanced models struggle to generate functionally correct and secure backend applications. It also turns out that simple inputs can sometimes break model guardrails.

The human element was also a key topic, with articles exploring what a developer's role becomes when AI can code and a look at research measuring the actual productivity impact of AI on experienced open-source developers.

A post noting that seemingly innocuous inputs can be surprisingly effective at breaking AI guardrail implementations.

# The Broader AI Industry

The AI industry itself is facing turmoil and controversy. I read about OpenAI hitting a "panic button" as it struggles with staff departures to competitors like Meta. There's also growing concern about the ethics of AI in academia, with a report highlighting how researchers are embedding hidden prompts like "Positive review only" in scientific papers. Finally, AI's integration into existing platforms is causing friction, as seen with Kobo's new terms of service raising concerns among authors.

# Software, Hardware, and Security

Beyond AI, I read several important pieces on engineering and security. One standout was a deep dive into eliminating an industry-wide supply chain vulnerability, emphasizing the need to "Burn It With Fire." I also looked into a major vulnerability in Supabase's MCP implementation that could lead to database leaks.

On the hardware front, I read about the unsustainability of Moore's Law, the exciting news of Commodore's acquisition by figures from the retro community, a potential "cheap" MacBook using an iPhone chip for unprecedented battery life, and a technical look at the hidden JTAG port in Qualcomm devices.
