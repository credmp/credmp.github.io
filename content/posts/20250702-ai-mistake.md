It is extremely hot here. I am still pushing the newsletter out, even though I just want to sit in an air-conditioned room playing video games. But here it is!

Last time, I talked about the risks of AI teams. Today, let's look at one of the weirdest and most dangerous problems with the AI "brain" itself: hallucinations.

So, what's a hallucination? It’s when an AI just… makes something up. It states false information as if it were a proven fact, and it says it with 100% confidence.

With a single chatbot, this is a problem. But in a team of AI agents, it can be a catastrophe. This is called a Cascading Hallucination Attack.

Think of it like that old game of "Telephone." The first person whispers a phrase, but makes a small mistake. By the time it gets to the end of the line, the phrase is completely wrong.

Now imagine that, but with AI agents that can actually act on that wrong information.

In a single agent, it can get stuck in a feedback loop. The agent hallucinates a "fact," saves it to its memory, and then reads that same false memory later, becoming even more sure that its lie is the truth.

In a team of agents, it’s even worse. Agent 1 hallucinates. It tells Agent 2 the fake "fact." Agent 2 tells Agent 3. Before you know it, your entire AI system is operating on a complete falsehood, leading to total chaos.

A huge part of this problem is us. We humans tend to trust the confident-sounding answers the AI gives us without double-checking.

So how do we stop it?

- Always check the AI's work. Especially for important tasks. Yes,  I know, you want to get to the coffee machine, but this is important. 

- Implement "multi-source validation," which is a fancy way of saying the AI needs to check its facts from several different places.

- Most importantly, never let an AI's unverified "knowledge" be the final word on anything critical. You need a human in the loop.

So, that’s my take on this piece of the AI security puzzle. But this is a conversation, not a lecture. The real discussion, with all the great questions and ideas, is happening over in the comments on Substack. I’d love to see you there.

My question for you is: What’s your single biggest takeaway? Or what’s the one thing that has you most concerned?
