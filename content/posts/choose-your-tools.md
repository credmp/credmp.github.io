I ‚ù§Ô∏è to build software. I sadly do not have a lot of time next to my daily work to spend on my side projects, so I have to be disciplined in where I invest time. I wish I could spend endless amounts of time on exploring new technologies, but sadly I simply do not have that time. In writing this is sometimes referred to as ["to kill your darlings"](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings).

> Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch wrote in his 1916 book On the Art of Writing: ‚ÄúIf you here require a practical rule of me, I will present you with this: ‚ÄòWhenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it‚Äîwhole-heartedly‚Äîand delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.‚Äô‚Äù

Luckily for me, I just finished my latest round of education, so I now do have time to spend on building some of the ideas that have been floating around in my head for the last 3 years. And I did start out writing stuff. Some in `Rust`, some in `Go` and others in `Clojure`.

Like many programmers I love to explore new languages, I think you always learn something new from them. As Clojure really taught me about functional programming when all I knew was imperative languages. In the end, after having a summer of not working on my studies I have 0 projects completed, but I do have 4 versions of them.

So, I decided to step back and evaluate. I decided to kill my darlings of different programming languages and focus solely on Clojure again. Development in Clojure conforms to [Rule 6](https://konmari.com/marie-kondo-rules-of-tidying-sparks-joy/) for me. While working out the problem I love the interactive build method. I actually like the parentheses, I know... weirdo me ü§ó.

You might even remember that I used to do [a live-streaming series](https://www.youtube.com/@BuildFunThings) in Clojure. I still don't have a lot of time to continue that one, but who knows... I might drop some videos later again.

Since the summer I have been somewhat involved in [Biff](https://biffweb.com/), a rapid prototyping web framework in Clojure. It provides a set of sensible defaults to just get started, and it allows you to easily change all its bits. I have been building my latest project on top of it, which, with a bit of luck, might even make it to production.
