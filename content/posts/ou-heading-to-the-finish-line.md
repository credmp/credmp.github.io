It has been a little while. I have been swamped with work and the work on my thesis, leaving no room to finish the Advent of Code or much of anything else.

Yesterday I gave my practice presentation for my thesis. This means I am one more step closer to the finish line. During the day there were many interactions with fellow students. One of the topics has been the templates to use at Open Universiteit. So, I thought I would just create a repository of the templates that I use, so that anyone can learn from them.

The repository is here: [https://github.com/credmp/ou-templates](https://github.com/credmp/ou-templates)
