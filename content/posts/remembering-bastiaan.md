Today the academic world is remembering Bastiaan Heeren, who passed away last week.

I spent the better time of a year working on my thesis, and before that I enjoyed lectures given by Bastiaan. He was a person with a great love for teaching, especially when you can get into the nitty gritty details of software quality and the benefits of functional programming.

I look back fondly on my time with Bastiaan. He was an open, warm, critical and encouraging human being. He had a great love for his family and work.

Right after [I graduated](/posts/master-of-science/) his illness progressed and as a result he was unable to join the graduation ceremony last September. We exchanged gratitude through email and in a blink of an eye, it is over. He was only 46.

You will be missed.
