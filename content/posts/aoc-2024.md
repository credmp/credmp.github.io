It is December again and that means it is time for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Due to my workload and family obligations I will probably not be able to get very far this year, but still I wanted to write a post about it.

This year I am using Java, together with my students. My goal is to write as modern as possible Java, which means using streams and new language constructs where possible.


## Day 1 {#day-1}

In day 1 we are parsing 2 lists of numbers, with the lists printed vertically. This means each line has 2 numbers, one for list one and the other for list two. To parse these data structures I used a very nice stream where I `map` each line onto a `String[]` using `split`.

To be sure that the input is valid, the `peek` method allows you to check if the result is what you intended, and otherwise an exception will terminate everything. From here I `map` the `String[]` into a `Pair` record which holds the 2 numbers. Streaming over the resulting `pairs` the left and right lists can be extracted quite easily.

I loved this approach, it is very straightforward and does not have a lot of control flow.

```java
@Override
public List<List<Integer>> parseInput(List<String> input) {
    var pairs = input.stream()
        .map(s -> s.split("\\s+"))
        .peek(parts -> {
                if (parts.length != 2)
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input format");
            })
        .map(parts -> new Pair<>(Integer.parseInt(parts[0]), Integer.parseInt(parts[1])))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

    var left = pairs.stream()
        .map(Pair::left)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

    var right = pairs.stream()
        .map(Pair::right)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

    return List.of(left, right);
}
```

Solving the problem with these lists was quite easy. In part 2 there was a need for a frequency table of a list. I also found a very nice solution to that problem using the `groupingBy` method from `Collectors`.

```java
input.get(1).stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(n -> n, Collectors.counting()));
```


## Day 2 {#day-2}

I really liked day 2, the first part was quite straightforward. You have to identify increment or decrement only lists and apply some conditions to them.

Part 2 was much more interesting, here you have to account for fault tolerance. In the Python implementations that were posted the common solution is to concatenate 2 parts of the array and then rerun the validation logic.

Using streams we can something very similar. First we use an `IntStream` to iterate over every `int[]` (report). Then for every `int` in that report, we construct a new array by `filtering` out the index of the current item. After that it is a simple case of determining increment or decrement and applying the conditional logic.

> Suppose you have a list of `[1,2,4,7]`, while iterating it will first hit index `0`, the `filter` will prevent that entry from continuing. Next `1` through `3` will continue and as a result of `toArray()` a new array will be constructed with only those items.

```text
x == 0
     |    map ------.
     v  -------     v
    [1, 2, 4, 7]    [2,4,7]
```

```java
input.stream()
    // Loop over the list
    .filter(in -> IntStream.range(0, in.length) // take a report
            // for every entry in that int[]
            .anyMatch(x -> {
                    // create a new list, excluding the one we are on now
                    int[] c = IntStream.range(0, in.length)
                        .filter(i -> i != x)
                        .map(i -> in[i])
                        .toArray();

                    boolean allInc = IntStream.range(0, c.length - 1)
                        .allMatch(i -> c[i] <= c[i + 1]);

                    boolean allDec = IntStream.range(0, c.length - 1)
                        .allMatch(i -> c[i] >= c[i + 1]);

                    boolean good = IntStream.range(0, c.length - 1)
                        .allMatch(i -> Math.abs(c[i] - c[i + 1]) >= 1 &&
                                  Math.abs(c[i] - c[i + 1]) <= 3);

                    // matching the condition
                    return (allInc || allDec) && good;
                })
            )
    .count();
```

My first solution was nothing like this, but after refining it I am very happy with how clean it came out.


## Day 3 {#day-3}

This was the traditional easy puzzle after a more complicated one. Basically simple parsing for which I used regular expressions. Nothing special, on to day 4.


## Day 4 {#day-4}

For day 4 I solved the first part with an over engineered path finding solution, which turned out to be quite the overkill, but extremely fun to program.

I really like the pattern in use, below is some of the code of it. First you create a `Deque` that holds the work, then you load it up with the initial starting points. In the case of the puzzle these are the location of the `X` characters.

From there you just loop over the `work`, taking a partial solution and seeing if any cells around it will lead to another partial solution, so from `XM` to `XMA` and on the next iteration to `XMAS`. The `dx` is a collection of `Coord` that indicate valid movements across the board.

```java
Deque<Path> work = new ArrayDeque<>();

// Load initial points
for (int y = 0; y < input.length; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < input[y].length; x++) {
        if (input[y][x] == 'X') {
            work.add( new Path(List.of(new Coord(x,y)), "X", null) );
        }
    }
}

// Process each outstanding point..
while (!work.isEmpty()) {
    var path = work.pop();
    for (Coord d : dx) {
        if (path.dir() != null && path.dir != d) {
            continue;
        }
        var newCoord = lastStep.add(d);
        // Ensure this is a valid point on the grid
        if (newCoord.x() >= 0 && newCoord.x() < input[0].length &&
            newCoord.y() >= 0 && newCoord.y() < input.length) {
            // ... create new paths and string based on location
            // Check if we have an end case, else add it to the work
            if (target.equals(xmas)) {
                matches.add(newPath);
            } else if (target.startsWith(xmas)) {
                work.add(newPath);
            }

        }
    }
}
```

A more straightforward approach, which was actually needed for part 2, is to just try to solve it in one step. First you iterate over both `y` and `x` coordinates looking for an `X`, just as above. When you find one, iterate over `[-1, 0, 1]` on both the `x` and `y` axis-es, using `dy` and `dx` for the **direction**. If both `direction` are `0`, we continue as it would give the current position. The beauty of this approach is that you can move outward in steps, `x + 3 * dx` will give you a value 3 cells in the give `direction`. From there it is a simple matter of checking if we are in bounds and if the letters spell **MAS**.

```java
for (int y = 0; y < input.length; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < input[y].length; x++) {
        if (input[y][x] != 'X') continue;
        for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
            for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
                if (dy == dx && dx == 0) continue;
                if (!(0 <= y + 3 * dy && y + 3 * dy < input.length &&
                      0 <= x + 3 * dx && x + 3 * dx < input[y].length)) continue;

                if (input[y+1*dy][x+1*dx] == 'M' &&
                    input[y+2*dy][x+2*dx] == 'A' &&
                    input[y+3*dy][x+3*dx] == 'S') {
                    matches++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For part 2 a similar approach can be used, however the order is not important. So I chose to create a `List` and then check against a target list with the `containsAll` method, it does not care about order.

```java
var x1 = List.of(input[y-1][x-1], input[y][x], input[y+1][x+1]);
var x2 = List.of(input[y-1][x+1], input[y][x], input[y+1][x-1]);
if (x1.containsAll( target ) && x2.containsAll( target )){
    matches++;
}
```

Another reminder to not over engineer at the start.


## Day 5 {#day-5}

Another fun puzzle, when I initially read it my mind jumped to graphs. There is a 2 part input, the first part being a list of rules, numbers that are only valid when they are placed in front of other numbers.

The second part of the input is a list of `report` structures. The first quest was to validate the reports and find only the valid ones.

My first attempt, in part 1, was to take the rules for a number (a `List<Integer>`) and see if there is an `anyMatch` of the sublist before it using `order::contains`. Basically if the pages is `75,97,47,61,53` and the rule `97|75` (97 should be before 75), the the loop will iterate over the pages, and check to see if `[75]` is in the list of rules for `97`.

```java
boolean isValid(List<Integer> pages, Instructions input) {
    var valid = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < pages.size(); i++) {
        var order = input.order().get(pages.get(i));
        if (order != null) {
            var hasAny = pages.subList(0,i+1).stream().anyMatch(order::contains);

            if (hasAny) {
                valid = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return valid;
}
```

Part 2 had us fixing the broken pages. After some initial magic with arrays I figured out it is a basic sorting problem. In Java you can use `Comparator` implementations to create custom sorting rules, as long as it responds with `-1,0,1` for to the left, the same, to the right. So the lambda `Comparator` takes a left hand side and right hand side value, retrieves the rules for the left hand side (if `null` it is equal `0`) and checks to see if the right hand side is in the ruleset (`-1`). If all checks fail, the value should go to the right hand side.

```java
var answer = 0L;
for (var pages : input.pages()) {
    var valid = isValid(pages, input);
    var work = new ArrayList<>(pages); // pages is immutable
    if (!valid) {
        Collections.sort(work, (lhs, rhs) -> {
                var order = input.order().get(lhs);
                if (order == null) return 0;
                if (order.contains(rhs)) return -1;
                return 1;
            });
        answer += work.get(work.size()/2);
    }
}
```

A surprisingly easy solution to a messy problem when you want to implement it yourself.
