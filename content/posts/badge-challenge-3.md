During each in-person Hack The Box meetup I have a small badge challenge that will give the first solver of the challenge a price. at the meetup of March 2023 there will be a very nice little challenge to be done as well, a beautiful NOVI hoodie. You can already download the password protected zip archive. The password will be shared during the meetup opening words.

-   [The zip archive](/files/badge3.zip) (sha1: 28e84243c79caefce06f62ba2c5d930de37a3439)

Good luck. Afterwards I will post a walkthrough of the challenge on this site. Badge Life is hard :)
