The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has its own Vulnerability Database, called the [European Union Vulnerability Database (EUVD)](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu). It's datasource is [The Vulnerability Lookup project](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org), a system that correlates various sources and streamlines Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD). It uses the Global CVE Allocation System ([link](https://gcve.eu)) as a source. This system is created with funding by the EU and is maintained by Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL), with a nice dashboard [here](https://vulnerability.circl.lu).
