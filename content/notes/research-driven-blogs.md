There are a million posts out there offering hot takes on every new piece of tech, and frankly, I'm not interested in adding another one to the pile. My goal is to cut through all that chatter by focusing on what the actual, reproducible research says.

It's the only way to get a clear picture of where things really stand, without the marketing hype or the doomsday predictions.
