# Vibe Coding


In Beyond Vibe Coding, Addy Osmani defines it like this:

“In vibe coding, you leverage powerful LLMs as coding partners, letting them handle the heavy lifting of code generation so you can focus on higher-level goals.”

“On one end of the spectrum lies vibe coding. On the other end is what I’ll call AI-assisted engineering: a disciplined method of weaving AI into each phase of software development, from design through testing, under clear constraints.
Both approaches leverage powerful AI, but their goals, audiences, and expectations differ markedly.”

Steve Yegge, co-author of Vibe Coding, told me what the term means to him:

“Vibe coding is when the AI writes the code and the human supervises.”
