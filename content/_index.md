My name is Arjen. I usually write something about the place I work at here. On March 21st I had my last day at NOVI and am currently taking a break. In April I will post my next adventure here...

I have been in the software and security industry for almost 30 years and have worked in:

- Internet providers (Chello / UPC, Tiscali - NL): Java
- Startups (Personify - USA, eBuddy - NL): Java, BigData
- Healthcare and FinTech (Infomedics - NL): Java and dotNet - Managed the IT and Development teams
- EduTech (NOVI - NL): Managed the development team building in Serverless, Javascript
- Education (Hogeschool van Amsterdan / NOVI - NL): teaching software security and software engineering courses

I am a member of:

- [NLJUG](https://nljug.org/): The dutch Java user group
- [VERSEN](https://www.versen.nl/): The dutch association of software engineers

In 2024 I completed my [Masters' Degree](/posts/master-of-science). My research topic was *BiDE*, a language and architecture for the creation of bidirectional diagrammatic editors. In essence a way to modify program text using diagrams and text at the same time, allowing stakeholders of different backgrounds to work on the same system at the same time. I worked on this thesis with [Bastiaan Heeren](/posts/remembering-bastiaan)  (Open Universiteit) and [Jurgen Vinju](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jurgenv/) (Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica).

In my spare time I love to explore the cutting edge of software engineering, exploring new languages such as Rust, Clojure and Golang in combination with Large Language Models and their novel applications.

I toot on the fediverse as [@credmp@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@credmp) and on [@arjenwiersma.nl](https://bsky.app/profile/arjenwiersma.nl) on Blue Sky.
