My name is Arjen. I am a Cyber Security Consultant for [Scyon](https://www.scyon.nl/). I help organisations with their Application Security, Offensive Security and (Cyber) Business needs. Roles that I like to fulfill: (C)ISO, Security Engineer, Engineer Manager, Senior Developer (Java or Rust).

I have been in the software and security industry for almost 30 years and have worked in:

- Internet providers (Chello / UPC, Tiscali - NL): Java
- Startups (Personify - USA, eBuddy - NL): Java, Big Data
- Healthcare and FinTech (Infomedics - NL): Java and dotNet - Managed the IT and Development teams

- [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-netherlands/): The OWASP Netherlands chapter

In 2024 I completed my [Masters' Degree](/posts/master-of-science). My research topic was *BiDE*, a language and architecture for the creation of bidirectional diagrammatic editors. In essence a way to modify program text using diagrams and text at the same time, allowing stakeholders of different backgrounds to work on the same system at the same time. I worked on this thesis with [Bastiaan Heeren](/posts/remembering-bastiaan)  (Open Universiteit) and [Jurgen Vinju](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jurgenv/) (Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica).

In my spare time I love to explore the cutting edge of software engineering, exploring new languages such as Rust, Clojure and Golang in combination with Large Language Models and their novel applications.
