My name is Arjen and I am the Manager of Product Development and Chief Lecturer at [Hogeschool NOVI](https://www.novi.nl). I work on creating the most modern and relevant educational (EduTech) products that we can offer. Through stategic partnerships and attracting the most talented content developers and technical staff we offer world class education to our students.

In my work as Chief Lecturer for Cybersecurity I focus on teaching students all there is to know about the technical side of Cyber Security. My main areas of expertise are Reverse Engineering, Infrastructure Security and Web Application Security. I also teach a wide range of Software Development courses, such as an introduction to programming, Java, DevOps and more advanced courses such as Datastructures & Algorithms, Secure Coding.

I have been in the software industry for more that 25 years and have worked in:

- Startups (Personify - USA, eBuddy - NL): Java, BigData
- Internet providers (Chello / UPC, Tiscali - NL): Java
- Healthcare and FinTech (Infomedics - NL): Java and dotNet
- EduTech (NOVI - NL): Serverless, Javascript
- Education (Hogeschool van Amsterdan / NOVI - NL): teaching software security and software engineering courses

I am a member of:

- [NLJUG](https://nljug.org/): The dutch Java user group
- [VERSEN](https://www.versen.nl/): The dutch association of software engineers

In 2024 I completed my {{< backlink "master-of-science" "Masters' Degree">}}. My research topic was *BiDE*, a language and architecture for the creation of bidirectional diagrammatic editors. In essence a way to modify program text using diagrams and text at the same time, allowing stakeholders of different backgrounds to work on the same system at the same time. I worked on this thesis with {{< backlink "remembering-bastiaan" "Bastiaan Heeren">}} (Open Universiteit) and [Jurgen Vinju](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jurgenv/) (Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica).

In my spare time I love to explore the cutting edge of software engineering, exploring new languages such as {{< backlink "rust" "Rust">}}, {{< backlink "clojure" "Clojure">}} and Golang in combination with Large Language Models and their novel applications.
