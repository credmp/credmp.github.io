On December 24 the last puzzle went live. It was quite an amazing experience. Over 500 people participated in the daily puzzles.
</p>

<p>
During the event several opportunities to give away prizes presented themselves. The CTF had 3 prizes to give away by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">Hack The Box</a> and an awesome Challenge Coin presented by <a href="https://www.novi.nl">NOVI Hogeschool</a>, my employer. Once the coins are available I will blog about them, for now you will just have to believe they are awesome!
</p>

<p>
During the last Hack The Box NL Meetup I gave a talk about the infrastructure and my experiences with hosting such a big event. The talk is linked below.
</p>

<p>
Some interesting posts I created along the way are linked below:

Included here is the talk I gave at the January meetup. It goes into detail about the infrastructure, the pitfalls of creating challenges and hosting an event that starts at 8am each day.

I have put all the challenges up on <a href="https://github.com/adventofctf/2020">Github</a> so you can run them yourself. They are based on docker containers, so the experience will be the same as during the event, minus the anti-cheat measures detailed in the video.
