This is an initial post to get started. I just launched <a href="https://www.adventofctf.com">Advent of CTF</a> and wanted to create a place to post writings about it.
</p>

<p>
The Advent of CTF is a Capture The Flag competition that is held during the first 24 days of December. Each day, at 8am CET a new challenge unlocks. The challenges range from easy to not so easy. The topics cover basic browser usage, encoding, SQL Injections, Type Juggling and many more.
</p>

<p>
Once the competition is underway I will post writeups of the challenges and insights into the infrastructure behind the project.
