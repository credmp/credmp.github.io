This is an initial post to get started. I just launched [[https://www.adventofctf.com][Advent of CTF]] and wanted to create a place to post writings about it.

The Advent of CTF is a Capture The Flag competition that is held during the first 24 days of December. Each day, at 8am CET a new challenge unlocks. The challenges range from easy to not so easy. The topics cover basic browser usage, encoding, SQL Injections, Type Juggling and many more.

Once the competition is underway I will post writeups of the challenges and insights into the infrastructure behind the project.

Go back to the [[../../index.org][homepage]].
