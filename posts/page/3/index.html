At NOVI we participate with a group of our students. We use the AoC throughout the entire curriculum as practice exercises to learn new programming languages or the application of data-structures and algorithms.
Day 1 was a tricky start for most people. Part 1 was not too bad, but part 2 tripped most people up. I guess the idea was that you would have to solve the challenge with an array iteration, but most students tripped up. They tried to match each word and replace the occurrence in the text, running head-on into the edge-case where 2 numbers overlap, such as ‚Äúeightwo‚Äù.

The Powerhouse Partnership: Open Universiteit and CWI While undertaking a Master‚Äôs thesis is a significant endeavor on its own, I always have to make it more complex. My research will be a collaborative effort between two prominent institutions: the Open Universiteit and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI).

A personal revelation that struck me during the process is the tight and rather vexing relationship between perfectionism, procrastination, and paralysis.
It‚Äôs often said that the perfect is the enemy of the good. In my quest for the ‚Äòjust right‚Äô words to articulate my thoughts, I found this saying to be glaringly accurate. The ticking clock became a dull backdrop to my cerebral scavenger hunt. My concentration started to drift and instead of zeroing in on my research proposal, I found myself fixated on, of all things, the color scheme of my desktop environment.

The purity of academics resides in students writing on their research and having their work peer-reviewed. But how can you now be sure that the student wrote the paper and how can you trust its content? Many universities, including the OU have written about it. The OU published an article in Modulair about it. Generally, the consensus seems to be that it is ok to use AI as an assistant, but you must write your texts.

I have decided to document my journey and experiences on my blog. Given that the thesis will play a pivotal role in my life for the next nine months, I expect it to be a thrilling journey.
Finding a topic As a student at Open Universiteit in The Netherlands, I had the opportunity to work with the Rascal programming language during the Software Quality Management course. I found the language intriguing and enjoyed working with it throughout the module. After consulting with my professor, we brainstormed various possibilities for my master‚Äôs thesis topic, ultimately settling on the creation of a visualization library for the language.

To do this I have started following courses at the Dutch Open Universiteit. They have a Master‚Äôs program that takes 2 years and you are able to follow it from home.
As this is my first post on the courses, I will give some background. As a teacher it is recommended to have a Master‚Äôs degree. As I had a whole lot of work experience my teaching activities were not a problem, but from an overall point of view I was advised to pursue an Master degree. As my highest educational level up to now is a Bachelor I first had to follow a pre-master program before I could start the Master program. I will write about my experiences of the pre-master program later.

I switched from eglot when I started using LSP more. The beautify of lsp-mode is that it will automatically install language servers as you need them. It also integrates excellently with dap-mode to enable debugging sessions. So, I switched to it, turned off all the information overload and I am quite happy.
One thing I do extensively is that I use LaTeX to make my slides for college class slides and class assignments. That means I have hundreds of directories with presentations, assignments and other documents. Each time I enter a directory for a class it will spawn an LSP session for that set of LaTeX files.
