For the last 18 months I have organized the dutch Hack The Box meetups. Due to COVID-19 they have all been as a digital meetup, but not less entertaining though.
</p>

<p>
During my time organizing the meetups the Hack The Box organization supports me in various ways; they give me stuff to hand out such as swag or VIP memberships, they help organize speakers for events when we don&rsquo;t have one ourselves and they provide me with Hack The Box goodies every once in a while.
</p>

<p>
One of the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; is to be named Hack The Box Ambassador. This is mostly just a title, but a very cool one :D.
</p>

<p>
As I just celebrated my first year as Ambassador I was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/blog/htb-ambassador-arjen-wiersma">Hack The Box Blog</a>. A very nice article exploring my motivations to start hosting a meetup, how it ties in to my work as Lecturer at NOVI Hogeschool and the rewards I get from hosting the meetup.
</p>

<p>
On the blog I am no stranger however. In the last 6 articles I appear in 3 of them. The others explore the use of <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/blog/htb-and-academia-winning-combo">Hack The Box for academia</a>, to study the field of hacking, and a <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/blog/novi-story">case study</a> on how NOVI Hogeschool utilizes the Hack The Box platform.
