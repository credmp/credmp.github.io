#+TITLE: Advent of CTF - Challenge 2
#+SUBTITLE: "Cookiemonster"

* Challenge

This challenge focuses on the way data is stored in the browser and the way it can be used to change the workings of a backend service.

The things you will learn are:

- How cookies are stored in a browser
- Identifying structures with *Base64*
- URL Encoding
- Manipulating JSON structures

* Solution

Once the challenge has loaded a webpage is presented with a login form.

A trained CTF player might try various advanced techniques, however the teaser below the login form says "Do not try too hard". Entering any combination of username / password will get you into the system.

As this is only the 2nd challenge it is not expected that the challenge will be overly complex. After you login you will notice that a cookie has been set. A hint is given by the /"Whoop Whoop" - @GevuldeCookie/ quote. You can view this in the DevTools (F12) or using a proxy like Burp. For now I will use the browser as the tool to examine web traffic.

The cookie is called "authenticated" and has a value that starts with =eyJ=. You will soon get familiar with identifying =JSON= datastructures in Base64 as they always start with the combination ={"= followed by some characters. That combination converts to =eyJ= in Base64.

As it is clear that it is a Base64 encoded string it can be copied over to [[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef][CyberChef]]. You might notice, whily copying, that the string ends in =%3D=. This is the URL encoding of an === sign. We could replace this manually, but CyberChef has decoders for this purpose. Select the /URL Decoder/ and /From Base64/ and drag them to the recipe column.

The JSON structure is visible now. It reads ={"guest":"true","admin":"false"}=. You can try various combinations of =true= and =false=. In order to solve the challenge the =guest= needs to be set to =false= and =admin= to =true=. Remove the previously used decoders from the recipe and add the =To Base64= encoder to create the payload.

Go to your browser, change the value of the cookie (double click on it), and reload the page. You will now be presented with the flag for this challenge.
