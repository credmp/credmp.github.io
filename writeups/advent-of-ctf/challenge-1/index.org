#+TITLE: Advent of CTF - Challenge 1
#+SUBTITLE: "The Source"

* Challenge

This is the first challenge in the Advent of CTF series. The first of a total of 24 that covers the entire month of December.

As it is the first it is intended to be beginner friendly. It also is meant to get people familiar with the system I have setup to claim badges and points.

** What you will learn

The challenge will learn the player to:

- Inspect page source
- How to identify and decode *Base64* encoding
- How to work with the Advent of CTF system

The challenge is available at [[https://01.adventofctf.com/][https://01.adventofctf.com/]]. Once requested the user is faced with a box to input Santa's password.

Obviously there are hints on the page. The player needs to find a *password* to enter into the box. In the footer there is a reference to **star wars**, which was famous for the quote /Use the force, Luke!/. In a CTF context that might sound like /Use the source/. Using *Inspect source* will show something at the very bottom.

The /hint/ in the comment is /This is an odd encoded thing right?/. The string that follows seems to be something that has been encoded. When the string is used as an input in [[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef][CyberChef]] it will immediatly say there is a /Magic/ function it can apply.

When you click the magic wand the text will be decoded. It will show ~advent_of_ctf_is_here~. This is the password that you can enter to unlock Santa's secrets.

I would like to take this moment to thank /Semper Fight/ (@DennisFeijth on Twitter) for finding a bug in the Badge Service. Fixed before we even started.
