Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an internet protocol used to manage and monitor network devices such as routers, switches, and servers. It operates by allowing network management systems to communicate with these devices, collecting and organizing information about their status and performance. SNMP identifies objects on a network using unique identifiers and manages network devices through get, set, and trap messages. SNMP has three main components: the management system that makes requests, the agents that reply to the requests, and the managed devices that are monitored and controlled by the management system. It is widely used by network administrators to proactively monitor network performance and troubleshoot issues on the network.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
