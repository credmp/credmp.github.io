I is relevant as of February 18th 2023. If the circumstances of my environment changes I will try to update this article to reflect the situation.

I like consistency and simplicity. I do not like to use many different tools to do different things, I rather spend my time learning to use a few tools very well then to follow the hype on the latest trend of tools for something we have been doing forever.</description></item><item><title>22 years of Emacs</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/22-years-of-emacs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/22-years-of-emacs/</guid><description>Where to begin&amp;hellip; I just watched David Wilson&amp;rsquo;s talk called M-x forever - why Emacs will outlast text editor trends. He gave this talk at EmacsConf 2021 which is a conference dedicated to Emacs. The talk made me reflect on my use of Emacs over the last years and then I realized that this year will mark 22 years that Emacs and I have been together. This (probably too long) article reflects on those years and dives into my use of Emacs.</description></item></channel></rss>
