I sadly do not have a lot of time next to my daily work to spend on my side projects, so I have to be disciplined in where I invest time. I wish I could spend endless amounts of time on exploring new technologies, but sadly I simply do not have that time. In writing this is sometimes referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings">&amp;ldquo;to kill your darlings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch wrote in his 1916 book On the Art of Writing: “If you here require a practical rule of me, I will present you with this: ‘Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it—whole-heartedly—and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.’”&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
