I have decided to document my journey and experiences on my blog. Given that the thesis will play a pivotal role in my life for the next nine months, I expect it to be a thrilling journey.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a student at &lt;a href="https://www.ou.nl">Open Universiteit&lt;/a> in The Netherlands, I had the opportunity to work with the &lt;a href="https://rascal-mpl.org">Rascal programming language&lt;/a> during the Software Quality Management course. I found the language intriguing and enjoyed working with it throughout the module. After consulting with my professor, we brainstormed various possibilities for my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis topic, ultimately settling on the creation of a visualization library for the language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Universiteit: Software Quality Management</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/ou-sqm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 16:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/ou-sqm/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have been working on getting my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Software Engineering. To do this I have started following courses at the Dutch Open Universiteit. They have a Master&amp;rsquo;s program that takes 2 years and you are able to follow it from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this is my first post on the courses, I will give some background. As a teacher it is recommended to have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree. As I had a whole lot of work experience my teaching activities were not a problem, but from an overall point of view I was advised to pursue an Master degree. As my highest educational level up to now is a Bachelor I first had to follow a pre-master program before I could start the Master program. I will write about my experiences of the pre-master program later.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
