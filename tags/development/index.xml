&lt;p>I ❤️ to build software. I sadly do not have a lot of time next to my daily work to spend on my side projects, so I have to be disciplined in where I invest time. I wish I could spend endless amounts of time on exploring new technologies, but sadly I simply do not have that time. In writing this is sometimes referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-your-darlings">&amp;ldquo;to kill your darlings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Traefik</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/setting-up-traefik/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 12:18:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/setting-up-traefik/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently came across &lt;a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/">Traefik&lt;/a>. It is a reverse proxy built specifically for services in the cloud. I was searching for a convenient (up-to-date) way to expose my project using a reverse proxy within &lt;code>docker-compose&lt;/code>. I used to use &lt;code>nginx&lt;/code> for this, but it then requires a generator and an lets encrypt listener (so 3 containers). Traefik only requires a single container and allows you to label your docker containers to apply rules to them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhance testability with selmer</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/using-selmer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 19:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/using-selmer/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my first article in a series called &lt;strong>Rock Solid Software&lt;/strong>. In it I explore different dimensions of software that does not simply break. You can write good software in any programming language, although some are more suited to a disciplined practice then others, Clojure is definitely in the &lt;em>relaxed&lt;/em> space of discipline here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I am exploring the use of Selmer templates in Clojure. If you have explored &lt;a href="https://www.biffweb.com">Biff&lt;/a> at all you will know that all the UI logic works by sending &lt;code>Hiccup&lt;/code> through a handler, which will turn into HTML through &lt;code>rum&lt;/code> (specifically the &lt;code>wrap-render-rum&lt;/code> middleware). If you provide a vector as a result for an endpoint, it will be converted to HTML.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My computing environment</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/my-computing-environment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 15:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/my-computing-environment/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a longer form article. I is relevant as of &lt;strong>February 18th 2023&lt;/strong>. If the circumstances of my environment changes I will try to update this article to reflect the situation. You can find the full source code of my dotfiles on &lt;a href="https://github.com/credmp/nixos-dotfiles/">Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I like consistency and simplicity. I do not like to use many different tools to do different things, I rather spend my time learning to use a few tools very well then to follow the hype on the latest trend of tools for something we have been doing forever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deployment Anxiety</title><link>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/deployment-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjenwiersma.nl/posts/deployment-anxiety/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let me tell you how it was to ship a product out to half a million people back in 1999. But before I do that, let me tell you why. Today I talked to one of my students and he mentioned that he was very nervous about a change he was making. He was afraid it would break things and that he would spend the afternoon working through his CI/CD pipeline to resolve issues.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
